This repository is very simple. The [AVLNode](https://github.com/5115-source/AVLTree/blob/main/AVLNode.py) class is used for defining a single node in the AVL tree. Then the [AVLTree](https://github.com/5115-source/AVLTree/blob/main/AVLTree.py) class utilizes this node class to create and properly manipulate a new AVL tree. Lastly the [AVLTreeExample](https://github.com/5115-source/AVLTree/blob/main/AVLTreeExample.py) file is the main method that demonstrates some of the abilities of the AVLTree class by creating a randomly generated new AVL tree and displaying different traversal orders of the AVL tree. I used ChatGPT to translate some given classes from java to python for use in this project. See comments in each class for more context.
